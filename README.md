# GPT2 Fine-Tuning Repository

The fine-tuned GPT2 bot is hosted here (The bot might be in sleep mode, so please awake it up and wait a bit until it loads): [Link](https://superbot-gpt2.streamlit.app/)

Description of the fine-tuning procedure:
- I used HuggingFace package to load pre-trained GPT2-small model and fine-tuned it on a toy dataset generated with help of ChatGPT;
- The model was fine-tuned on prompt-to-nodes pair examples;
- The whole training script is located in the `fine_tune_gpt2.ipynb` notebook file.
